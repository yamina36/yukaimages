<p class="description">Although I’m looking forward to spring/summer, I’ll be sad to see our backyard rink go. It’s been another great winter for outdoor skating and my two boys took full advantage. Despite getting his butt kicked by his older brother, my youngest son’s skating drastically improved over the last 3 months. No children were harmed during the filming of this video. Thanks to my wife Kelli for helping me shoot this past weekend and for putting up with my non-stop camera obsession. In this (quick cut style) video, either a person, object or thing is centered in every scene. Here’s a whole bunch of good ol’ Canadian hockey in under one minute. Crank it up on a good sound system or use headphones for a better overall viewing experience.

Shot using a Blackmagic Pocket Camera, edited with FCPX and coloured with DaVinci Resolve.
