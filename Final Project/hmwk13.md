## Project Procedure: describe your data processing, visualization selection, and analysis post-visualization
I started thinking about to make a [histogram map](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/histogram.html) whcih expresses the time-based transition of social security expences for people who have disability.

I decided to combine it with Choropleth Map which expresses the geographical data of patient worker list.

I used datas below:

* [Data Retrieval: Labor Force Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab6.htm)
* [DSee How Your State Ranks In Employment Among Workers with Disabilities](http://fortune.com/2017/02/28/disability-employment-rank/)

### Analysis
I assumed that New York State and California states, emigrant-friendly states are also promoting employment of people who have disabilities. But the reality was different. Rather than, the state who has few population and few immigrants positively hires disabled people. The reason of that companies do not have many choices in rural state in the US? As expected, the number of employed people with disabilities is very small compared to general people.
